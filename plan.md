4. **Week 4**: Phase 5 (CLI) + Phase 6 (Documentation/Release)

## Backward Compatibility Strategy

- Keep original `main.go` functionality intact during development
- Use v2 module path if breaking changes are necessary
- Provide migration guide for existing users
- Tag last v1 version before major changes

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Race detector passes all tests
- [ ] Concurrent usage benchmark shows no performance degradation
- [ ] At least 80% test coverage
- [ ] Examples run successfully
- [ ] Documentation is clear and comprehensive
- [ ] Can be used as drop-in replacement for timing needs
